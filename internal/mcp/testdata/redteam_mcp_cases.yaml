# AgentShield MCP Red-Team Regression Test Cases
#
# Each case tests a tool call scenario that the MCP policy engine should
# correctly evaluate. Two decision levels:
#   expected_decision — what the policy evaluator should produce
#
# Format:
#   id:                unique identifier (mcp-rt-NNN-slug)
#   description:       why this matters
#   tool_name:         MCP tool being called
#   arguments:         map of tool arguments
#   expected_decision: ALLOW, AUDIT, or BLOCK
#   expected_reasons:  substring(s) that must appear in triggered reasons
